parser is a program that reads the content of a file and analyzes each line to determine if they are valid mathematical expressions that involve only addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.

The program can be compiled by running the command “make” and executed by running the command “parser ‘filename’” where ‘filename’ is the name of the file with the content to be parsed. It may be necessary to run the command “./parser ‘filename’” to indicate to the terminal the program is in the current directory.
